## HBNet External Services

This repository contains examples of various external services that can be used with the HBNET Data Gateway to provide some type of useful SMS services.

These external services interface with the data gateway via MQTT. There are numerous MQTT libraries in different programming languages available. The intent of external services is to make it easy for other people to write useful applications.
