## HBNet External Services

This repository contains examples of various external services that can be used with the HBNet Data Gateway to provide some type of useful SMS services.

These external services interface with the data gateway via [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) ([MQTT basic concepts](https://www.hivemq.com/mqtt-essentials/)). "The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers." - [mosquitto.org](https://mosquitto.org/). There are [numerous MQTT libraries in different programming languages](https://mqtt.org/software/) available. The intent of external services is to make it easy for other people to write useful applications.
